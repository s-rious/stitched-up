**Version ALPHA 1.0.0**

Stitched Up is a game developed with the primary focus on Silis, a 16 year old boy who is venturing into finding out who he is and the mental struggle that follows. Silis, unbeknownst to him, is suffering from severe depression and anxiety, which later transitions into a diagnosis that causes a further spiral. Silis is a kid who primarily focuses on himself, staying away from any problems no matter the cost.  These problems, whether at school, home, or with his friends, always get pushed away by his own mental struggle to learn from them, but instead decides the best way to deal with them is to simply act like they donâ€™t exist. This is what causes the initial suspicion of Silis having some form of a mental illness, as he pushes away self deprecating, suicidal, and harmful thoughts and decides suppression is t
the best way to overcome them. As the game progresses, the player is forced with difficult decisions, typically not given a simple answer or an option that is obvious in its sensitical decisions, much like Silis not able to properly process these decisions and make critical thinking decisions.
